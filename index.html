        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>A Bézier curve is a parametric curve related to the Bernstein polynomial. It is used in computer graphics and
            related fields for computer fonts, illustrations and animations.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The curve is named after Pierre Bézier,a French engineer and one of the founders of the fields of solid,
            geometric and physical modelling as well as in the field of representing curves, especially in CAD/CAM
            systems. As an engineer at Renault, he became a leader in the transformation of design and manufacturing,
            through mathematics and computing tools, into computer-aided design and three-dimensional modeling. He used
            the curve for designing the bodywork of Renault cars</p>
        <p>The mathematical basis for Bézier curves—the Bernstein polynomial—had been known since 1912, but the
            polynomials were not applied to graphics until some 50 years later, when they were widely publicised by
            Pierre Bézier. The study of these
            curves was however first developed in 1959 by mathematician Paul de Casteljau using de Casteljau's
            algorithm, a numerically stable method to evaluate Bézier curves at Citroën, another French automaker.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Bézier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves hat can be scaled indefinitely.
            "Paths", as they are commonly refered, are not bound by the limits of resterized images and are intuitive to
            modify.</p>
